    "### 4-1. Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, computers are inherently non-understanding entities and strive to maintain their non-understanding nature. One of the examples of a computer's non-understanding is its inability to comprehend texts and similarities between them. The challenge lies in the fact that, to make a computer understand a text, we have no choice but to generate a vector representation of it. A common representation in computers for texts is using ASCII or UTF codes for character storage and employing a sequence of these codes for text storage. However, the issue with this representation is that it lacks any connection to the semantic meaning of words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to introduce a new representation for sentences. Suppose we have a collection of m sentences, each consisting of n distinct words. We will define the following two matrices based on the words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![word embedding](https://corpling.hypotheses.org/files/2018/04/3dplot-768x586.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) **Word Frequency Matrix:**\n",
    "   - Each word that is more frequently repeated in a sentence will likely play a more prominent role in the meaning of that sentence.\n",
    "   - The word frequency matrix, denoted as $F$, is an $n \\times m$ matrix, where its element $(i,j)$ represents the frequency of word j in sentence i.\n",
    "   - For example, in the sentence bellow we have 6 words, and the word \"desert\" is repeated twice. Therefore, the frequency of this word in the sentence is $\\frac{2}{6}$.\n",
    "   > \"I like eating dessert in the desert,\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$F_{ij}=\\frac{|\\{\\text{repetitions of word j in sentence i}\\}|}{|\\{\\text{words in sentence i}\\}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Word Occurrence Matrix:**\n",
    "   - Words that appear in more sentences probably have less specific meaning.\n",
    "   - The occurrence matrix (or vector) of words is an n × 1 matrix, where its i-th element is equal to the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of sentences to the number of sentences containing the i-th word.\n",
    "   - In mathematical terms, if $D$ is the set of all sentences, and $D_i$ is the subset of sentences that contain the i-th word, then the i-th element of the word occurrence matrix (denoted as I) is given by:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     I_i=\\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{D_i}\\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Now, the representation of the i-th sentence is obtained by multiplying the corresponding row of the word frequency matrix by the word occurrence matrix element-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we have a set $S$ containing a certain number of sentences. In the first step, you need to compute the representations of these sentences. Then, a query sentence is given, and its representation is calculated based on the previously computed representations of the sentences. Finally, you need to return the index of the most similar sentence in $S$ to the query, determined through the **cosine distance** determined by the angle between the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any of these steps, you should remove punctuation marks from the text. Also, consider case insensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "write a function `query_sentence` that takes the set of sentences $S$ and the sentence $x$ and returns the closest match and it index.\n",
